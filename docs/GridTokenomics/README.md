## Token Functions

- User Incentives: GRID tokens serve as the primary incentive for users to contribute their bandwidth and storage resources as cache nodes. By relaying video streams to other viewers, cache nodes earn GRID tokens, encouraging widespread participation and enhancing the efficiency of the streaming media GRIDet.
- Audience Engagement: Viewers are rewarded with GRID tokens for engaging with their favorite content, such as following and actively participating in discussions. This incentivizes audience involvement and strengthens the bond between content creators and their communities.
- Advertiser Benefits: GRID's token economy facilitates direct targeting of audiences by advertisers at a reduced cost. This creates a win-win situation where advertisers reach their desired audience more effectively, while viewers are rewarded for their attention and engagement.
- Creator Rewards: Content creators can receive GRID tokens directly from their audience as gifts, fostering a supportive ecosystem where creators are duly rewarded for their contributions.
- Business Opportunities: Streaming and content platforms can unlock new revenue streams by integrating GRID tokens into their ecosystems, tapping into the growing network and expanding their user base.
- Profit Model: GRID's profitability stems from providing accelerated services to enterprises and individuals. Node operators contribute resources with minimal additional costs, benefiting from the sunk costs of running terminal nodes. The repurchase and destruction of tokens help adjust the interests of investors, users, and the entire ecosystem, ensuring sustainable growth and value creation.
- Governance and Accountability: Token holders play a crucial role in governing the network through voting on protocol modifications. This democratic approach ensures continuous evolution and adaptation to the community's needs while safeguarding against malicious proposals. The Council, comprised of elected members, maintains order, stability, and oversees the implementation of proposals and actions within the ecosystem.
