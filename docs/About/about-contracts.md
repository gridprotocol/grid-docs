## Block Chain

The blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger that combines technologies such as distributed storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and cryptography. In the blockchain, data is secured and trusted through encryption algorithms and consensus mechanisms. Each node maintains a complete copy of the entire system and participates in data verification and updates. The blockchain records transaction information by creating data blocks (blocks). Each block contains a certain number of transaction data and the hash value of the previous block, forming a growing chain. This structure ensures that once data is recorded, it becomes difficult to tamper with, providing transparency and traceability of transaction history. As a result, blockchain technology is widely used in digital information storage, identity verification, smart contract execution, asset management, and other fields.

In the GRID project, blockchain and smart contracts running on the blockchain are used to facilitate the registration of computing power nodes, storage of user-node service orders, and automatic fee settlement. The entire settlement process is automated by the contract code without human intervention, ensuring transparency and security in the order payment process.

## Contracts

The contract is used to record the registration information of nodes (CP) and the information of orders (Order) created by users.
