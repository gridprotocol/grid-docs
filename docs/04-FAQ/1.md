## Where is Platform running?

The platform refers to a series of service interfaces provided by the service provider to the users, and it is the responsibility of the service provider to start and maintain it.

The platform is designed to replace users in interacting with blockchain contracts. Therefore, users do not need to interact directly with the blockchain. Instead, they send their task requests to the platform, which is responsible for interacting with the blockchain and returning the final execution results to the frontend for display.

Please refer to the previous relevant sections for the interaction between the frontend and the platform.
