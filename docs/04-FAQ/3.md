## How to customize resources as a user?

When a user creates an order, they need to specify the quantity of resources they want to purchase. When deploying an application, the user first selects the YAML template for the application. Then, based on the user's order details, the backend adds the container's resource requirements and limits (requests, limits) to the container resource section of the YAML file. This allocation ensures that the application is assigned the quantity of resources purchased in the user's order.
